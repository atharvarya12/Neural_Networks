# Neural_Networks
So these are my learning projects for the implementation of neural Networks that I design 

## numpynn-for-mnist 
this is a neural network for image digit classification using numpy, linear algebra and calculus from scratch.

original project is on kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/code/atharvexr/numpynn-for-mnist/notebook
